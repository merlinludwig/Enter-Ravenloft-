Castle Ravenloft was built atop the ruin of an older fortress by artisans, wizards, and workers loyal to Strahd's family. Strahd rewarded the castle's genius architect, Artimus, with a crypt in the castle's catacombs. The castle was named after Strahd's mother, Ravenovia, who also lies entombed below.

“_I called for my family, long unseated from their ancient thrones, and brought them here to settle in the castle Ravenloft._” ~ Tome of Strahd
