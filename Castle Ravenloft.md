Castle Ravenloft was built atop the ruin of an older fortress by artisans, wizards, and workers loyal to Strahd's family. Strahd rewarded the castle's genius architect, Artimus, with a crypt in the castle's catacombs. The castle was named after Strahd's mother, Ravenovia, who also lies entombed below.

Castle Ravenloft is Count Strahd von Zarovich's accursed sanctuary. Here Strahd committed his bloodiest crimes and began the cycle of despair in which all Barovia remains locked. Lurking Undead, tormented spirits, and Strahd's other servants haunt the vast castle, each serving the count's schemes; reflecting some aspect of his depraved past; or protecting his coffin, which lies hidden within the castle's vast catacombs. Mementos of lost times and fallen heroes lie scattered throughout the count's home. Strahd keeps these relics close, but that might hold the key to his undoing.
