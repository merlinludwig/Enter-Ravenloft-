A fence of wrought iron with a rusty gate encloses a rectangular plot of land behind the dilapidated church. Tightly packed gravestones shrouded by fog bear the names of souls long passed. All seems quiet.

In contrast the disrepair of the burned out, ruined church next door, someone has been tending the graves, keeping weeds in check. And perhaps, more importantly, making sure the dead don't rise again.

The [[Castle Ravenloft]], home of the Count Strahd von Zarovich, looms above.
