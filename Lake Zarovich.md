At the foot of a mountain, nestled in the misty forest, is a large lake. The water is perfectly still and dark, reflecting the black clouds overhead like a monstrous mirror. A stench worse than rotting flesh fills the putrid air.  Along the south shore is the main docks of [[Vallaki]]. Deep within this large lake leaves everything to the imagination and all the horrors that reside there.
