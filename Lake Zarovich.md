At the foot of a mountain, nestled in the misty forest, is a large lake. The water is perfectly still and dark, reflecting the black clouds overhead like a monstrous mirror. A stench worse than rotting flesh fills the putrid air.  Pulled up along the south shore are three small rowboats always. A fourth boat can be seen in the middle of the lake, but its been empty for some time. Deep within this large lake leaves everything to the imagination and all the horrors that reside there.
