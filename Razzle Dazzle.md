Entertainer. Host. Madman. All words that have been used to describe Razzle Dazzle, host of the Myst Tournament, a semi-regular fight to the death in Barovia's Arena. For a man as seemingly boisterous and public-facing as he is, little is actually known about the entertainer. He obviously has an _incredible_ amount of power over what happens in his arena. He is somehow able to procure obscure and dangerous monsters from all over the multiverse. He can change the very shape and locale of the grounds the fighters fight on. And seemingly, can even go so far as to destroy the monsters at will that his fighters struggled against.

An enigmatic man for sure, but one thing is for _certain_: the _show_ will go on.

Rumor has it that his mansion at the edge of [[Vallaki]] has a showroom displaying trophies of all ~~his victims~~ the adventurers that fall in the arena. Though none have actually seen this in person.
