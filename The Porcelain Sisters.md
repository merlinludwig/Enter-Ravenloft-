**Description:** The Sisters have been shown to be keen on bets and deals as a way to right perceived wrongs. When they speak they do so as one mind, splitting their sentences between the three seamlessly. A faint grinding of stone and scream of stressed glass can be heard as they move, as they become agitated this becomes more pronounced.

Just off of the edge of the quaint [[village of Barovia]] is a usually quiet and small cemetery for the few deceased that are able to be reclaimed by the locals. Though as with everything in Barovia, nothing sleeps for long, not even the dead. When this happens the village procures help in cleansing the grounds of the risen undead. Typically, its not much, a few skeletons, specters, and maybe a couple shades. However, the most recent infestation has revealed the likely source as well as a previously unknown faction within Barovia.

Answering the call to arms a group of five adventurers cleared the cemetery. Not without some trouble and mutual bloodshed of course, but this is expected from the adventurers of Barovia. As they slew the last remnants of the infestation, a skull wreathed in flames, a disturbing building that was both a small decrepit shack as well as an opulent mansion layered in the same space on top of each other. Battling the ensuing migraine and vertigo that even perceiving the structure caused.

Finding a way inside through a hole in the roof/open window on the second floor the party crawled within to find an old abandoned social room expected of the mansion. Windows and cabinets of fine tea sets lined the walls with large oaken and iron doors standing behind the players. Before them was a lit fireplace with a red velvet and bronze couch facing it. Sitting in the seat were three silhouettes and the gentle clatter of porcelain tea sets. The group would come to know these three individuals as one, The Porcelain Sisters.

Finding themselves in the room with the apparent source of the anomaly as well as the possible source of the repeated uprisings the party readied themselves for a fight they would forever remember. Seeing the remnants of the jaw of the skull they slew they made their approach expecting to possibly meet their end in a gruesome fight. Instead they were warmly greeted with tea.

The Fae Five spent the better part of the night conversing with these creatures. A gruesome battle it was, but not one of blood, no. It was a balancing act for all involved to not bring the wrath of the demonstratively powerful entities. Through careful uses of words and a sly scheme of holy water as the diffuser for the tea that Ric offered The Sisters the Fae Five spilled a cup on the jaw of the skull vanquishing it for good. What came next none were ready for.

The boiling point of The Sisters was reaching its critical mass and the party was rushing to find a way to flee realizing they had little hope of even putting up a fight to these beings. The assorted cups, plates, and kettles poured out of the cabinets in waves. Small human like phalanges extending from all sides of the stoneware they moved like a raging tide to block the exits. In a final bid for their life Lars began to strike a deal, his name for their lives. 

Quite enjoying this prospect The Sisters nearly agreed. But before the deal was struck Ric uncharacteristically interrupted the deal to his own detriment. He offered his name instead and agreed to their stipulation for a monthly meeting with The Sisters. They agreed and offered their own names to the Shadar as well as an offer that once a month both The Sisters and Ric could request one favor at their scheduled Tea Time.

They then promptly struck down the dog much like Vesper was, a beam that turned the creature to ash. Though it was just a conjuration the effect held strong on the group. The disparity of power and unwillingness to listen from the Lord of the Land was shown, but at the cost of shattering the trust that Lars had for them due to the ruse of the conjured animal. Losing the bet Lars was struck with three favors. One from each of The Sisters. 

The party entered with the hopes of gaining one more ally in their struggle against the God of this land but left with only more chains tying them down. However, the month has passed and it is time for Tea once more. They have brought a large party of roughly a dozen adventurera this time. Perhaps this time the now Promised Two will be able to break their bindings with their allies at the very least.

Another month, another visit. This time by twelve. Mysteriously they were split in half having two concurrent meetings. This revealed almost how warped space and time are within the confines of the shack~~mansion~~. 

Tensions began high for the group containing the of the four remaining remnants of the Fae Five. While Lars and Ric addressed the elephant of the room of Rics stolen true name and Lars's broken trust the remaining shared tales with the sisters.

As these tales were shared the other group was faced with a dilemma. Unwittingly to them The Sisters home world was ravaged and enslaved by a dragon of godlike proportions, and what do they bring with them? A dragon, of historically the fiercest and cruelest of varieties. Words of soothing did little to calm their distaste. 

As the time of tales came to a close in the first room Ric offered a trade for his name, progeny for freedom. Dubious at first the sisters teetered on the brink of fury, but seeing Moz's conviction and that this was not a ploy their tune quickly changed as they accepted their future son. Shortly there after there was a knock on the door.

Not terribly unlike their compatriots tension were high due to the fragility of The Sisters tolerance for the salamander. Between Gans whimsical rhymes, Korvins hospitable curiosity, and Georgs pure naivety they managed to keep tempers down and moods high. Through a line of questions on The Sisters benefactor Korvin received a temporary gift of the ability to see the threads of fate. Each party members led to eachother and the sisters, which in turn led as one to the door way out. Excusing themselves and thanking the Sisters for their hospitality they made their way out to meet their fate.

Back in the first room nobody jumped to get the door, tensions still high. Moz however broke the stale mate and opened the door and meeting the man behind the Sisters.

We end this months meeting here, The Sisters desire satiated and a mysterious new entity introduced. Seek out the brave adventurers who risked themselves in a gamble with supping with hags and hear their story. Perhaps fate will lead you down a new road and out of the mists.
