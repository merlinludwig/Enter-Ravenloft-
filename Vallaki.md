The Old Svalich Road meanders into a valley watched over by dark, brooding mountains to the north and south. The woods recede, revealing a sullen mountain burg surrounded by a wooden palisade. Thick fog presses up against this wall, as though looking for a way inside, hoping to catch the town aslumber.

The dirt road ends at a set of sturdy iron gates with a pair of shadowy figures standing behind them.

# 6th of Ugavr, 737BC

Smoke billows into the sky above Vallaki, the plume visible in the south of the town above the Burgomaster's mansion. Distant shouting and screaming can be heard in that direction. Wandering the streets you see some signs of violence; blood splatters, discarded weapons. You see curtains twitch, as locals peek out, but do not venture out, and finally the church bells of St. Andral's and you hear more screaming.

"Demons in the streets!!!" you hear Bethel scream from her shop as he protector comes out to stand in front of her and lead her back in to safety.

But there are no guards in sight, no one to protect, until a middly aging woman appears, all business. Two young men appear with her, armed, and townsfolk start to arm themselves at her direction.

"Quickly now, we cannot let disaster strike, we cannot be shown to be weak. Protect one another. We cannot let the Baron's foolishness leave us vulnerable!"

The inauguration of Lady Wachter as the new Baroness and Burgomaster of Vallaki of Vallaki has taken place ~~without a hitch~~ with only one *minor* hitch, and together the new government of Vallaki can only improve the well-being of all residents of the Bright Dominion of Vallaki.
Today is a good day, to be followed by many more hereafter.

In her acceptance speech she thanks her family, sheds a tear over the loss of her husband to have not seen this day, mourns the many who were lost to fiend attacks and angers at the many more who have died over time due to Vargas's previous negligence, and sets out to amend that, introducing new laws for the protection of all of her constituents so that they be as safe and as happy as possible. 

She **encourages** all to, on this blessed day, register at one of the designated registration desks that have been set up around town.

Everyone who does submit themselves for [registratration](https://discord.com/channels/905604470644285460/1201488826552553502) will be rewarded for their commitment to this this town, and additionally anyone who also helped protect the town in the past will be rewarded for their hard work and sacrifice.

Those who register will receive:
> Official Shield of Vallaki 
> When you show this insignia shield (badge) with the Wachter crest on to a citizen of Vallaki who is loyal or neutral towards Lady Fiona Wachter, you have advantage on any Charisma (deception or persuasion) checks when you interact with them and they are more likely to be trusting, and less likely to become hostile towards you if prompted (DM dependant).
