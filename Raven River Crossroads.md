You see a weatherworn signpost next to the road. The three arms of the sign point along the three branches of the road. The arm pointing north reads [[Krezk]], and through the woods you can see an arching stone bridge spanning a river. The arm pointing east reads [[Vallaki]], and the road slopes up gradually in that direction. The arm pointing southwest reads [[The Wizard of Wines]]. The road slopes gently downward in that direction.

This stretch of the Old Svalich Road has multiple branches. One branch heads north, quickly turning into a dirt path that leads to [[Van Richten's Tower]] on Lake Baratok. One branch heads south, becoming [[Tsolenka Pass]] as it winds through the lower mountains and clings to the side of [[Mount Ghakis]]. A third branch heads west toward the Wizard of Wines winery and vineyard, dipping south as it changes from a road into a gravel trail.
