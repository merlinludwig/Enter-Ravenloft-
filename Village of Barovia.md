Tall shapes loom out of the dense fog that surrounds everything. The muddy ground underfoot gives way to slick, wet cobblestones. The tall shapes become recognizable as village dwellings. The windows of each house stare out from pools of blackness.

The village of Barovia is the saddest place in the land, its residents so terrified of Strahd that they rarely venture from their homes. The village lies in the shadow of [[Castle Ravenloft]], buried under fog but still unable to hide from the vampireâ€™s sight.

Lying in the shadow of [[Castle Ravenloft]], the village of Barovia is oppressed by fear. The villagers rarely venture from their homes, suspecting their neighbors of wickedness and fearing evils are taking root in the shadows. Their fears are largely justified, as ghosts and vampire spawn haunt the town, and many locals have been consumed by their own callousness or wicked temptations. A rare exception to the village's cold desperation can be found at the local tavern called the [[Blood on the Vine]]. Those few who would oppose Strahd's evil congregate here.
