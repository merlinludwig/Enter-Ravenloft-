Music chimes throughout the [[Svalich Woods]] as the unseen sun sets over the valley and as the final bits of daylight disappear. In a sudden burst of what appears to be arcane power, an opera house begins to rebuild itself from ruins with walls covered in golden wallpaper, silver statues, velvet flooring, and a crystal chandelier.

People say there was an opera house like this centuries ago but it burned away, why would it rise again? no one knows and many believe it is just a silly illusion that was created to spook a few adventurers, but those who receive a letter from a mysterious O.G. we'll find out this is much more than just some silly little parlor trick.
