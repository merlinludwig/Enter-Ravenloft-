*The fog spills out of the forest to swallow up the road behind you. Ahead, jutting from the impenetrable woods on both sides of the road, are high stone buttresses looming gray in the fog. Huge iron gates hang on the stonework. Dew clings with cold tenacity to the rusted bars. Two headless statues of armed guardians flank the gate, their heads now lying among the weeds at their feet. They greet you only with silence.*

*These old walls are the last bastion between the struggling [[Village of Barovia|township of Barovia]] and the wicked and unpredictable creatures of the landscape, and as such are prone to sudden attacks.*
